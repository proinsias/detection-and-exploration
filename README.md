I present the discovery of three transiting planets (TrES-2, TrES-3,
and TrES-4) of nearby bright stars made with the ten-centimeter
telescope Sleuth as part of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey
(TrES). TrES-2 is the first transiting exoplanet detected in the field
of view of NASA’s Kepler mission. Of the 20 known transiting
exoplanets, TrES-3 has the second shortest period, facilitating the
study of orbital decay and atmospheric evaporation. Its
visible/infrared brightness makes TrES-3 an ideal target for
observations to determine the atmospheric composition. TrES-4 has the
largest radius and lowest density of the known transiting
planets. These three planets have radii larger than that of Jupiter,
and the radius of TrES-4 significantly exceeds predictions from models
of hot Jupiters, indicating a possible lack of an energy source in
these models. 

I present the results of Spitzer observations of TrES-2. I reject
tidal dissipation of eccentricity as an explanation for the inflated
radius, and examine the spectrum for evidence of atmospheric
absorption.

I have monitored 19 fields each containing 6,000–36,000 stars for
evidence of transits. I discuss the rejection of six of my candidate
transiting systems from an early field that represent examples of the
67 astrophysical false positives that I encountered in Sleuth
data. These six false positives highlight the benefit of a multisite
survey such as TrES, and also of comprehensive follow-up of transit
candidates. As a further example, I present the candidate GSC
03885-00829 from Sleuth data that was revealed to be a blend of a
bright F dwarf and a fainter K-dwarf eclipsing binary. This candidate
proved nontrivial to reject, requiring multicolor follow-up photometry
to produce evidence of the true binary nature of this candidate.

The yield of planets from transit surveys is not yet well constrained
or understood. There are numerous factors that affect the predictions
such as the amount of correlated photometric noise present in the
data. Here I present an analysis of my ability to recover fake
transits in TrES data. I examined both the automated transit-search
algorithm and my own visual identification process. I find the
recovery rate of my visual analysis to be 87% for those transit
candidates that had a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to be
flagged by my transit-search algorithm and readily identifiable by
eye.
